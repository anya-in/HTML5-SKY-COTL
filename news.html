  <p>
    The ‘Season of Dreams’ was our most heartfelt season yet, focusing on the beauty of a community coming together to uplift a local young performer. With the addition of two new breathtaking areas and unique quests to relive the young skater’s memories, the team aimed to deliver a Seasonal experience that took players on the emotional rollercoaster of bringing a personal dream to life.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this season wrapping up later next month, we’re excited to share some early developer notes about our next season coming to Sky in early spring 2021

    SEASON OF ASSEMBLY
  </h3>
  <p>
    For the first time in an Adventure Pass season, the spirits in Season of Assembly are all children, allowing players to better connect with their sense of inner child. Set in the rainy Hidden Forest, this story follows a lone Scout spirit who invites players to help build and then adorn a treehouse fit for hosting friends.</p>
 
  <p>Throughout the course of the season, players will be prompted to visit the dwellings of the six other Scout spirits in order to gather the perfect items for improving the space. Each spirit this season is individually related to the realm Ancestors of Sky – with their theme and items a reflection of their personalities.</p>

 
   <p>Players will also be able to look forward to an introduction to new quest mechanics and activities this season, including a new scavenger hunt game mode that we’ve been excited for players to get their hands on. The new activities start out able to be completed solo and aren’t timed, but as you progress further, some quests require the aid and collaboration of other nearby players.</p>
 
   <p>The addition of treehouse items allows the team to develop for a larger range of self-expression in Sky. One of the most exciting aspects of this season is that there’s an emphasis on items and props that players get to wear. This item type has been historically rare in past seasons, but with this season there will be six. We’re excited to see how this system grows as the world of Sky continues to expand.</p>
 
   <p>It’s our hope the theme this season will have a nostalgic ring to it – reminding us of the sense of discovery and kinds of experiences you have when you’re a kid, the world is very big and exciting, and you’re going out on adventures.</p>
 
   <p>We’re still working hard to finalize all of the details of this season, and we can’t wait to hear your thoughts on this next Adventure! The Season of Assembly will be available for pre-order next month.</p>
